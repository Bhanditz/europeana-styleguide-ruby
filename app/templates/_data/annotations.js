Providing access to the main site navigation is a good way for the user to jump off to another section and avoids leaving them with a dead end. Also, some mobile sites like <a href=\"http://bagcheck.com/\">Bagcheck</a> and <a href=\"http://contentsmagazine.com/\">Contents Magazine</a> keep the primary navigation at the footer and simply link to it with an anchor in the header. That way the nav stays accessible but the focus stays on on the core page content.</p>"

Whether a user is having trouble with the site or simply has some questions about the product he's about to buy, it's a smart decision to provide a clickable phone number to facilitate that call. What happens when desktops and other non-phone devices click on the <a href=\"http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/click-to-call-links-mobile-browsers\">tel link</a>? Well, some devices (like iPads and other tablets) ask the user if they'd like to add the number to their contact list, other desktops open 3rd party VoIP programs like Skype, and others simply give an error message.</p>"
